# TurtleBot 3 SLAM

![TurtleBot 3 SLAM](link_to_image)

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide on how to execute various SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) methods on a simulator with the TurtleBot 3. SLAM is a fundamental technique in robotics that allows a robot to build a map of the environment while localizing itself within that map.

## SLAM Methods

In this repository, you will find information about the following SLAM methods:

- **CARTOGRAPHER**: A real-time mapping system developed by Google.
- **GMAPPING**: A grid-based mapping algorithm developed for the ROS (Robot Operating System).
- **RTAB-Map**: A graph-based mapping and localization system developed for complex and long-term environments.
- **Slam_Toolbox**: An open-source collection of SLAM algorithms for ROS, including methods such as Hector SLAM and LOAM.

These tools are essential to enable the TurtleBot 3 to effectively map its environment and accurately localize itself within that environment. This repository provides step-by-step instructions on how to set up and execute each SLAM method in the TurtleBot 3 simulator.
